The monitor of my university class is going married. So some of my classmates prepared a gift for him.

In order to give him a surprise, I designed a red packet embed in avatars of our classmates who have donated money to our monitor. (If I just put our classmates' names on it, it is not cool at all.)
I believe that it will become a valuable memory of his whole life.
