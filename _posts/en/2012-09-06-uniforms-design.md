This was desgined during the graduation season. When I looked at the logo of KFC, I though that this kind of style may be useful for our uniforms.
So I though about a method which can translate the pictures of all my classmates to monochromatic avatars.

## Principles of Design

1. **Alignment** - Edges line up along common rows or columns
2. **Closure** - To perceive a set of individual elements as a single, recognizable pattern
3. **Constancy** - To perceive objects as unchanging

## How it works

You may be curious about the building process of these avatars. All we need to do is just take a picture for your model, and make it into a monochrome style by using Photoshop, Picasa or some other image processing tools.
