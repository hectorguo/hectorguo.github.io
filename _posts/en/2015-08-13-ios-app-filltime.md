This is a Time Log App, used for curing procrastination. I often found myself having wasted much time on some trivial stuff, such as surfing Twitter, Weibo, or watching the same movies over and over again. So I decided to develop an application to log what I have done every hour, and this visual result can help me to make some improvements on my schedule.

This app is under development and based on Unity engine, which can provide an amazing physical effect.
