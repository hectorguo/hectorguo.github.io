APP (Architecture and Program Principles)

Recommended Books:

- **Clean Code**
- **The Pragmatic Programmer**

# Architecture Section Preview

## Loosely-Coupled System(SOA)
Challenges: how to define the Services and their interaction

## Non-functional Requirements

## Remote Interface (RESTful APIs)

## Asynchronous Systems
Challenges:

- need rethinking with an event-driven approach
- cannot rely on remote services even more than before
- Testing complicated

Reactive Concept

## Stateless Decision Systems
Approach:

- how to build decision system that can read to a dynamic state of the world
- how to coordinate a collection of systems

## Modern Architecture Concepts
Approach:

- How to make the right tech and arch decisions for a given problems

## Data Pipelines
Approach:

- How to develop data-driven use cases

# Coding Section Preview

## Managing Technical Debt
## Handling Logic Failures
Log , but how to prevent too much

## Instrumenting for Verification
Approach: how to verify non-functional requirements

## Unit and Regression Testing (Continuous ?)
## Testing Asynchronous Code

### Medical Device Marketplace
multi suppliers
multi groups (with different hospitals )
negotiate online

Players:

- hospitals
- suppliers
- manufactures
- groups

Concept:

- Contract (group, suppliers, negotiation)
- Price Lists
- Orders
- Negotiation
- Commitment
- Historic Date (Read, Update, Delete )
- Returns
- Payment Terms

Action: CRUD

Behavior:
Hospital <> Group

- Negotiate Group, Suppliers, Items, Historic Date (optional, maybe first time)
- Commitment Volumes, historical volumes
- Volume, items, price when signing contract
- volume, items, price when paying

## Week 4
### 4. Error Handling, REST

- bad request (get)
- depending failure ()
- internal error (login)
- Bad code (global)

#### http status code

- 2xx
    - 200
    - 201
- 4xx (Client Side)
    - 400
    - 401
    - 403
    - 404
    - 405
- 5xx (Error)
    - 500
    - 501


```
GET http://server/car/298
```
Response:

```js
{
    statusCode: 404,
    errorCode: 1132, // (reserved not valid)
    errorMsg: 'Car is not a valid resource'
}
```

Table of error code & message:

| Code   |      Message      |  Properties |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| 1132 |  {} is not a resource |  |

```
POST /user

Possible error: 
1. Invalid resource (url not exist)
2. Empty Body
3. Invalid Format (XML, JSON)
4. Invaild Attribute
5. Missing Required Attribute
6. Id should not be provided
7. Duplication Attribute
8. Attribute not unique (email address, etc.)
9. Invaild Attribute value (type error)
```

#### Instrumentaion
- Rate limites (day, hour, month)
    - log: count API calls by user/api key.
    - check against quota/limit
- Measure Performance (Response, load)
    - timestamp
- throttling
    - check for total api call count
- Usage Patterns
    - logging
- Logging -> Error
- Documentation Errors

### 5. Persistence (database), API Version Management
### 6. Scale, Performance, Security
### 7. Async, Reactive programming, Data pipeline
