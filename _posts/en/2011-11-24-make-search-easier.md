It is a web app developed by myself in Technology Innovation Competition.

## Purpose

The purpose of the app is to recognize a Traffic Sign quickly by using mobile phones or PCs. I like go hiking and often enounter some weird traffic signs I don't know. Given this situation, I decided to develop it by using Internet and Image Processing Technology in order to quickly identify a traffic sign.

Now this app had been shut down because of no fees to maintain it.

## Basis

- Algorithm for finding visually similar images
- Google Image Search Service
- HTTP
- Python
- PHP

Here is a demo video.
